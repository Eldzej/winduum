# 🎨 Winduum UI

> Still in very-early development.

Lightweight, modern, modular low-level CSS framework build on top of **Tailwind**

- 💡 Modern
- 📦 Modular
- 📏 Responsive
- ✨️ Progressive

It's a mix of words **Tailwind** _(Popular CSS utility framework)_ and **Tuum** _(Estonian word for "core")_.<br>

Winduum approach to **Tailwind** is little different. It encourages to write components in CSS or other (pre/post)-processors.
And to use Tailwind only for utility classes to enhance the components. It also leverages the use of CSS properties as much possible.<br>

Winduum contains only very little javascript, and you can bring any javascript framework with you on top of that.
